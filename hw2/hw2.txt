Parallel Coordinate Plots
Dear all,

In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

PS1: If you don't know what parallel coordinates are, please watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B6uz0H7BSo

PS2: Name your page by "your_student_ID.html" or "your_student_ID.js" and upload them to the server we provide. The links for uploading your homework will be announced soon. Note that you also have to upload your homework to E3.

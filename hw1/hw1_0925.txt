Dear all,



I announce the first homework so early because I would like to push you to watch the lecture video.

It is also great to learn more since the semester just started. You should not have homework or exams in other classes and be able to watch this long video. Enjoy. :-)



============================================================================



In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3. Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool. Besides, please render scatter points in different colors to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.



Please let me know if there are any questions.



PS1: You can choose other libraries rather than D3. But please make sure your vis system is a web-based tool. 

PS2: Name your page by "your_student_ID.html" or "your_student_ID.js" and upload them to the server we provide. The links for uploading your homework will be announced soon. Note that you must upload your homework to E3.

Correlation Matrix
Hi Everyone,

For this assignment, you are tasked with creating three correlation matrices corresponding to the three categories of abalone data: male, female, and infant, utilizing D3. The design should facilitate users in swiftly discerning correlations among attributes and in making visual contrasts across the three abalone types. Feel free to employ color codes, interactive elements, or any effective design principles to bring out the nuances in the data. Should you have any queries, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Note 1: To understand the abalone data in-depth, visit https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone

Note 2: When saving your work, use the format "your_student_ID.html" or "your_student_ID.js". Instructions for uploading your work to our designated server will be provided shortly. Remember, you must also submit your assignment on the E3 platform.

Best regards, 

YuShuen

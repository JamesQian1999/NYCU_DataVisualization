Sankey Diagram
Objective:
Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

Example code: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html

Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

 

Requirements:
Data Preparation:

Preprocess the data, ensuring you have valid pairings between attributes for the Sankey Diagram. This might involve calculating frequency counts for each category combination across the mentioned attributes.

Sankey Diagram Creation:

Display relationships between the categorical attributes: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, and safety.
Ensure that the width of the bands in the Sankey Diagram represents the proportion or count of the dataset that holds that relationship.
Design & Interactivity:
Draggable Nodes: Users should be able to rearrange the Sankey nodes to declutter the view or focus on specific relationships.
Tooltips: Implement interactive tooltips that show ratios or raw counts when users hover over the bands in the Sankey diagram.
Visual Design: Ensure a clear color distinction for different categories, and provide a legend or key that explains any color or symbol used.
Submission:
Ensure your code is well-commented and organized. Include any necessary documentation or user guides that can assist in understanding and navigating your visualization.

 

Support:
Should you have any queries or face challenges during the assignment, don't hesitate to reach out for clarification or guidance.
